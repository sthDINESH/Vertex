   ↓
2. Click "Start Mapping" (Guest mode) or "Sign Up"
   ↓
3. Enter concept details (name, level)
   ↓
4. View generated prerequisite tree
   ↓
5. Click "Test Knowledge" on first prerequisite node
   ↓
6. Answer 3 quiz questions
   ↓
7. See result (passed/failed) reflected on tree
   ↓
8. Repeat steps 5-7 for remaining nodes
   ↓
9. Click "View Learning Path"
   ↓
10. See personalized study resources
    ↓
11. Prompted to sign up to save progress
```

**Core Flow: Returning User**
```
1. Login
   ↓
2. View dashboard with saved learning paths
   ↓
3. Click existing path → Resume where left off
   OR
   Click "New Concept Map" → Start fresh assessment
```

**Interaction Patterns:**

1. **Concept Input**
   - **Pattern**: Form with instant validation
   - **Feedback**: Disabled "Generate" button until concept name entered
   - **Loading State**: Animated spinner + "Analyzing dependencies..." text
   - **Error Handling**: Inline error messages (e.g., "Failed to generate. Try again.")

2. **Tree Navigation**
   - **Pattern**: Hierarchical tree with expandable branches
   - **Visual Hierarchy**: Indentation shows dependency depth, lines connect nodes
   - **Affordance**: "Test Knowledge" buttons use action color (blue)
   - **State Changes**: Node color changes immediately after quiz completion

3. **Quiz Taking**
   - **Pattern**: Modal overlay (maintains context without page change)
   - **Progress**: Question counter (1/3, 2/3, 3/3) + progress bar
   - **Interaction**: Single-select radio buttons → "Next" button
   - **Feedback**: No immediate answer feedback (prevents retake gaming)
   - **Completion**: Modal closes automatically, tree updates

4. **Results Display**
   - **Pattern**: Accordion-style resource cards (collapsed by default)
   - **Prioritization**: Failed concepts listed first
   - **Visual Hierarchy**: Numbered steps (1, 2, 3...) show recommended order
   - **Resource Cards**: Expandable with icon-coded resource types (video/article/interactive)

**Micro-Interactions:**

| Element | Trigger | Animation | Purpose |
|---------|---------|-----------|---------|
| Quiz button hover | Mouse over | Scale 1.05 + shadow | Affordance |
| Node status change | Quiz completion | Color fade transition (0.3s) | Smooth feedback |
| Loading spinner | API call start | Rotate 360° infinite | Processing indicator |
| Success message | Save action | Slide in from top + fade out after 3s | Confirmation |
| Resource card expand | Click | Height transition (0.2s ease) | Progressive disclosure |
| Form validation | Input blur | Red border + error text fade in | Error prevention |

**Accessibility Considerations:**
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab order follows visual hierarchy (input → generate → tree nodes → quiz)
- **Screen Readers**: ARIA labels on all interactive elements (e.g., "Test your knowledge of Linear Algebra")
- **Focus Indicators**: Blue outline on focused elements (2px solid)
- **Color Blindness**: Status uses icons + text labels, not color alone (✓ passed, ✗ failed, ? untested)
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44×44px for mobile buttons

**Data Flow Examples:**

**1. User Creates Concept Map (Authenticated)**
```
1. User submits concept form → React component
   ↓
2. API client sends POST /trees/create { concept, level, subject }
   ↓
3. Express route handler validates JWT from cookie
   ↓
4. Server calls AI service layer → POST to Gemini API
   ↓
5. AI returns prerequisite tree JSON
   ↓
6. Server saves tree to MongoDB (learningPaths collection)
   ↓
7. Server responds with tree data + _id
   ↓
8. React updates state, renders TreeView component
```

**2. User Takes Quiz (Session State)**
```
1. User clicks "Test Knowledge" → QuizModal opens
   ↓
2. API client sends POST /ai/generate-quiz { concept, description, level }
   ↓
3. Server calls Gemini API with quiz prompt
   ↓
4. AI returns 3 quiz questions (JSON)
   ↓
5. Server sends quiz to client (does NOT save yet)
   ↓
6. React stores quiz in local state (not persisted)
   ↓
7. User answers all 3 questions
   ↓
8. React calculates pass/fail (2/3 threshold)
   ↓
9. API client sends PATCH /trees/:id { quizResults: { nodeId: true/false } }
   ↓
10. Server updates learningPath document in MongoDB
    ↓
11. React updates TreeView with new node status
```

**Component Communication Patterns:**

| Pattern | Use Case | Implementation |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| **Props Down** | Parent → Child data flow | `<TreeView tree={treeData} />` |
| **Callbacks Up** | Child → Parent events | `<QuizModal onComplete={(result) => ...} />` |
| **Context** | Global auth state | `AuthContext.Provider` wraps app |
| **Local State** | Component-specific data | `useState()` for form inputs, quiz state |
| **API State** | Server data caching | Custom hooks like `useLearningPaths()` |

**State Management Strategy:**

```javascript
// Global State (React Context)
AuthContext {
  user: { id, email } | null,
  login: (credentials) => Promise,
  logout: () => Promise,
  isAuthenticated: boolean
}

// Local State (useState)
ConceptMapperPage {
  concept: string,
  subject: string,
  level: string,
  tree: TreeData | null,
  loading: boolean,
  error: string | null
}

QuizModal {
  currentQuestionIndex: number,
  answers: boolean[],
  showResults: boolean
}

// Server State (Fetched via API)
Dashboard {
  learningPaths: LearningPath[], // Fetched from GET /trees
  loading: boolean,
  error: string | null
}
```

**API Contract Examples:**

```typescript
// POST /auth/signup
Request: { email: string, password: string }
Response: { user: { id, email }, token: string }

// POST /trees/create
Request: { concept: string, subject?: string, level: string }
Response: { 
  _id: string,
  treeData: { target: string, prerequisites: Node[] },
  createdAt: Date
}

// GET /trees
Response: LearningPath[] (user's saved trees)

// PATCH /trees/:id
Request: { quizResults?: Map, studyResources?: Map }
Response: { success: boolean, updatedPath: LearningPath }
```

**Security Considerations:**

- **Authentication**: JWT stored in HTTP-only cookie (prevents XSS attacks)
- **Authorization**: Middleware verifies userId from token matches resource owner
- **Input Validation**: Joi schemas validate request bodies before processing
- **Rate Limiting**: 100 requests/15 min per IP (prevents API abuse)
- **CORS**: Whitelist only frontend domain (Vercel URL)
- **Environment Variables**: API keys never exposed to client
- **Password Security**: bcrypt with 10 salt rounds

**Performance Optimizations:**

- **Frontend**:
  - Code splitting by route (React.lazy)
  - Tree virtualization for large graphs (react-window)
  - Debounce concept input (reduce API calls)
  - Optimistic UI updates (quiz results show immediately)

- **Backend**:
  - MongoDB indexes on userId, createdAt (fast queries)
  - Response compression (gzip)
  - AI response caching (same concept → cached tree for 24h)

- **Deployment**:
  - Vercel Edge Network (CDN for static assets)
  - Render auto-scaling (handles traffic spikes)

**Error Handling Strategy:**

```javascript
// Client-side
try {
  const tree = await generateTree(concept);
  setTree(tree);
} catch (error) {
  if (error.status === 401) {
    // Redirect to login
  } else if (error.status === 429) {
    showError("Too many requests. Try again in 1 minute.");
  } else {
    showError("Failed to generate tree. Please try again.");
  }
}

// Server-side
app.use((error, req, res, next) => {
  logger.error(error);
  
  if (error.name === 'ValidationError') {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: error.message });
  }
  
  if (error.name === 'UnauthorizedError') {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid token' });
  }
  
  // Generic fallback
  res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
});
```

#### Wireframes & Interface Design

**Design Principles:**
- **Mobile-First**: Wireframes prioritize mobile layout, then scale up to tablet/desktop
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information revealed as needed, avoiding cognitive overload
- **Consistent Patterns**: Reusable UI components across all screens
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Size, color, and spacing guide user attention
- **Touch-Friendly**: Minimum 44×44px touch targets on mobile

**Risk Mitigation:**
- AI API reliability: Test fallback error messages, monitor rate limits each sprint
- Authentication complexity: Deploy incrementally (Sprint 3), test heavily before Sprint 4
- Deployment issues: Deploy early and often to catch issues sooner
- Scope creep: Strictly adhere to "MUST HAVE" features, defer "SHOULD HAVE" to Post-MVP
